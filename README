DEVELOPEMENT FLOW

This Application was developed using Node js.

The entry point is server.js file which creates multiple process using cluster library. 
The server.js has multiple endpoints as listed below;
/api/buy        -       Intended for the sole purpose of buying stocks
/api/view       -       For viewing available Stocks (Database Screenshot as mentioned in assignment doc.)
/api/view/logs  -       For viewing logs (Logs Screenshot as mentioned in assignment doc.)
/api/update     -       To update Stock database

Each of these endpoints are routed to the stock/ directory with each of the files named appropriately.

The following libraries were used in its development :
restify - To Create an Http Server which can accept user requests and send out response
mysql - To Connect to the mysql database and run queries
es6-promise  - To return a promise using "reject(error)" or "resolve(success)" from called functions
underscore - To perform Array Manipulations.
os - To get System processing cores available
Cluster - To create multiple child processes to acheive the Multi threading documentation (https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html)

pm2 process manager - This was used on my development system to manage the Application processes.
